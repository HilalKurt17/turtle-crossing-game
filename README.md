# TURTLE CROSSING GAME
## About the Project
This project is developed in Python with objected oriented programming. Turtle is moved to go across the road without hitting any car. If the mission is completed successfully, level will increase. 

There are three main rules in the game, which are,

* Turtle can move only forward,
* Speed of cars will increase, as level increases,
* Turtle has three hearts/life. After all hearts are finished, the game will over.
